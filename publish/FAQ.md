**Q1)** Whatâ€™s this page?
**A1)** This page will contain all my notes for my time at UTD. I will begin attending in Fall 2025, and Iâ€™m looking to graduate in Spring 2029. Feel free to [DM me on Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/jeydinpham) with any questions & enjoy :))

**Q2)** Do you happen to have notes for $x$ class?
**A2)** Nope! Every class Iâ€™ve taken (decent) notes in is posted on this page, & it will be updated consistently. There _may_ be other classes Iâ€™ve taken, but the notes in those classes arenâ€™t worth their own pages.

**Q3)** I found a typo or misinformation! Now what?
**A3)** Hooray! Message me on Discord & I fix it. Itâ€™s $100\%$ one of two things: I wrote that section of the notes while sleep deprived, _or_ itâ€™s just an example of how much I enjoy spreading misinformation ðŸ˜ˆ Just kidding, Iâ€™m probably just stupid & wrote it wrong. Hmu :)

**Q4)** I take notes on Obsidian too! Can I add my class that isnâ€™t listed below?
**A4)** Whaaaaaat??? Twins fr ðŸ‘¬. For real though, [hit me up on Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/jeydinpham)!
